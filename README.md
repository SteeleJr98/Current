My Butts Discord Bot  
Default prefix is '&' and can be changed on a per-server preference mentioning the bot also works as a prefix  
.env file with the bot's token is needed as well in the format of DISCORD_TOKEN={token} replacing {token} with the token for the bot  
Additionally if you're using this bot as your own you'll need a second like in the .env file in the format of OWNERID={userID} replacing {userID} with the owner of the bot. This is needed for commands that require you to be the bot's owner to use
