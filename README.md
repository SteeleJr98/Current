My Butts Discord Bot  
Default prefix is '&' and can be changed on a per-server preference  
ffmpeg is used in the music commands (currently broken) so make sure you know how to use that shiz  
.env file with the bot's token is needed as well in the format of DISCORD_TOKEN={token} replacing {token} with the token for the bot  
A "Queue" folder is needed for the queue command (currently broken) and has to be in the same directory as the main Python file
