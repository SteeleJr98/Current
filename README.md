My Butts Discord Bot  
Default prefix is '&' and can be changed on a per-server preference mentioning the bot also works as a prefix  
ffmpeg is used in the music commands (currently kinda broken) so make sure you know how to use that shiz  
.env file with the bot's token is needed as well in the format of DISCORD_TOKEN={token} replacing {token} with the token for the bot  
Additionally if you're using this bot as your own you'll need a second like in the .env file in the format of OWNERID={userID} replacing {userID} with the owner of the bot. This is needed for commands that require you to be the bot's owner to use  
A "Queue" folder is needed for the queue command (currently broken) and has to be in the same directory as the main Python file
